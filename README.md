### 🔗 **Add to Server**
If the "Add App" button on the profile isn't working for your server, use this **Direct Invite Link** (Updated):
👉 **[Click Here to Add Chrono Cloudy to Server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1467874196423049279&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)**
*(This forces the "Add to Server" screen)*

1.  Go to the **Discord Developer Portal**.
2.  Select your App -> **Installation**.
3.  Under **Installation Contexts**, check **Guild Install**.
4.  **CRITICAL FIX**: Under **Default Install Settings**, select **Guild Install**.

    -   Check `bot` (This is required for the bot to join the member list!).
    -   Check `applications.commands`.
    -   **Permissions**:
        -   To keep it simple: Check **Administrator** (easiest for small bots).
        -   Or check: **Send Messages**, **Embed Links**, **Attach Files**, **Manage Messages** (for dashboard cleanup), **Manage Events** (for sync).
5.  Save Changes.
